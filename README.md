A game for Ludum Dare 44

Unfortunately I couldn't figure out a proper system to deploy this game and 
just deliver you a nice executable in time. To run this, please install python 3
from

https://www.python.org/

When installing, make sure to add python to your PATH by checking the corresponding
checkbox in the installer.

Once you installed python, you have to install the arcade library

The easiest way to do this is by opening the terminal/shell of your choice and 
typing :

pip install arcade

Should that not work, please check out the arcade library documentation for help here:

Thank you for trying my game, I hope you liked it.
